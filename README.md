# Urban Computing App - Assignment 4: NoiseViz

This is my web app, NoiseViz, created as part of Assignment 4 for the module CS7NS4 Urban Computing in Trinity College Dublin using React.js, d3.js and Google Firebase.

### To run the application locally: 

1. Clone the repository

2. Install relevant dependencies using npm:

        `npm install react`
        `npm install d3`
        `npm install react-leaflet`

3. Due to potential CORS issues when running locally, a CORS proxy has been included. To activate it visit "https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/" and request temporary access.

4. Run the code locally using `npm run dev`
